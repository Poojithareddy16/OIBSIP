# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository! This repository houses the source code, datasets, and documentation for three significant data science projects:

## 1. Iris Flower Classification

- A classic machine learning task focused on classifying iris flowers into distinct species based on their key characteristics.
- Explore the code and detailed analysis in the [Iris_Flower_Classification](./Iris_Flower_Classification) directory.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis

- An in-depth analysis of unemployment data to uncover trends and factors influencing unemployment rates.
- Access the code and comprehensive analysis in the [Unemployment_Analysis](./Unemployment_Analysis) directory.

## 3. Car Price Prediction

- A regression project where we predict car prices using machine learning models. The goal is to estimate the prices of various car models.
- Find the code, datasets, and notebooks in the [Car_Price_Prediction](./Car_Price_Prediction) directory.

### How to Explore

- Each project directory contains a README file with specific details, including data sources, methods, and instructions on how to run the code or replicate the analysis.
- Please navigate to the respective project directories for in-depth documentation.
